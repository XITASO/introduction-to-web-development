This project contains files for HTML and CSS.

You can simply open the files with a browser.

-> See folder `public/1-html`
-> See folder `public/2-css`

Or as in the presentation, run a small node server to serve the files and enable live reload, so you do not need to refresh the web page every time you change a source file.
You don't necessarily need to run the server, it's just more convenient to show a web page with live reload during development.

To start, run `npm install`, then `npm start`, then navigate to http://localhost:3000

The file `public/index.html` is being displayed, and you can copy/paste the examples from the html/css folders into it.
